# fetchNSEOptionChainData

On executing this application , it gives NSE option chain data with current Nifty spot price nearer to strike price (10 Upper and 10 Lower strike prices)
It gives OI, OI Chng, and volume data for both PE and CE. 

It also indicates Highest OI, Highest OI CHNG and Highest Volume on every run. With the help of this data we can predict about nifty to gap up or gap down for next day.

Trade can be taken at 3:20pm the previous day. Basically it will help to take BTST trade. 

For logic to predict gap up or gap down. Ping me.
